This change led to token validation failures, resulting in a spike of 401 Unauthorized responses and authentication failures for all affected services. The evidence shows that the configuration update on 2026-01-24 at 03:31:56 UTC caused valid tokens issued by the removed issuer to be rejected, disrupting service authentication. Remediation involved restoring the old issuer to the allowed list and implementing a gradual migration to prevent similar issues in the future. The root cause was thus a misconfigured auth-service after a recent update.",
    "recommendations" : "The root cause of the incident was a configuration change to the auth-service's allowed issuer list, caused by a ConfigMap update that removed the old OAuth issuer. This invalidated existing tokens, leading to authentication failures and a high rate of 401 Unauthorized responses. To resolve the incident, administrators should immediately re-add the correct issuer to the auth-service configuration, as was done by adding the old issuer back. For prevention of recurrence, it is recommended to implement canary rollouts when making configuration changes to the auth-service, ensuring that any issues can be detected before full deployment. Additionally, establishing thorough change management and validation processes for configuration updates can help identify potential mismatches or omissions beforehand, minimizing disruption.",

This was exacerbated by slow queries or potential connection leaks, which caused the pool to reach 100% utilization, resulting in no available connections and request timeouts. The high latency (P95 exceeding 500ms) stems from this pool exhaustion, directly impacting the api-service's performance. To remediate, it is necessary to identify and optimize slow queries, check for connection leaks, and consider increasing the connection pool size or setting appropriate query timeouts.",
    "recommendations" : "To resolve this incident and prevent recurrence, it is recommended to: 1. Optimize slow queries in the database to reduce query execution time and alleviate connection pool exhaustion; 2. Monitor and analyze the connection pool metrics regularly to detect potential saturation early; 3. Consider increasing the connection pool size if system capacity allows, while also ensuring queries are efficient; 4. Check for and fix connection leaks to prevent connections from being held longer than necessary; 5. Implement query timeouts to avoid long-running queries; 6. Test query performance in staging before deploying changes; 7. Review recent deployments for potentially problematic changes; 8. Engage DBA team and consider escalation if connection pool exhaustion persists; 9. Establish proactive monitoring for high latency and connection pool utilization to trigger alerts before reaching critical levels.",

Remediation steps include restoring database connectivity, ensuring proper service dependencies, and implementing health checks to detect such failures earlier.

    "rootCauseAnalysis" : "The root cause of the incident is the failure of the payment-service due to an unreachable payment database, which caused downstream failure and increased error rates in order-service. This upstream failure led to the circuit breaker opening to prevent further cascade effects, triggered by connection timeouts and a 503 error response. Remediation involves restoring network connectivity to the payment database and verifying the payment-service's downstream dependencies to prevent recurrence.",
    "recommendations" : "To resolve this incident and prevent recurrence, it is essential to fix and monitor the connectivity of the payment-service's database, ensuring stable communication with the payment service. Additionally, enhancing upstream and downstream service monitoring can facilitate early detection of failures. Implementing more resilient circuit breaker settings can prevent the system from experiencing widespread failures during downstream issues. Regularly testing dependencies, especially critical ones like the payment-service and its database, and establishing alert thresholds aligned with normal error rates will help maintain system stability and reduce the risk of similar incidents.",
