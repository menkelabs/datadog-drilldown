#### Alert
- **ID:** 785d0ced-7c68-486c-9ec3-8cb995a11a30
- **Name:** API P95 Latency Alert
- **Service:** api-service
- **Severity:** WARNING
- **Message:** P95 latency exceeded 500ms threshold. Current value: 2450ms

#### Analysis

**Initial Assessment:**
```
The most likely causes are slow database queries or connection leaks leading to connection pool exhaustion, resulting in high latency and connection errors. Initial investigation should focus on checking database query performance, connection pool metrics, and recent deployments for potential query regressions. Additionally, monitoring service resource utilization and downstream service latency can help identify root causes. Remediation steps include optimizing slow queries, setting query timeou
...
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
```
The root cause of the incident appears to be connection pool exhaustion in the HikariCP pool used by the api-service. This exhaustion was caused by slow queries or a connection leak, which led to a high connection utilization (at 100%), increased request latency with a P95 value of 2450 milliseconds exceeding the threshold, and eventual unavailability of connections. The evidence shows that a new query held connections for an extended period after deployment, and the connection pool became saturated, leading to timeout errors. Remediation steps include identifying and optimizing slow queries, monitoring and alerting on connection pool metrics, checking for connection leaks, testing query performance before deployment, setting appropriate query timeouts, and potentially increasing the connection pool size if needed.
```

**Recommendations:**
```
The root cause of the incident is connection pool exhaustion in the api-service due to slow queries or connection leaks, leading to high latency and request timeouts. Recommended actions to resolve the incident include identifying and optimizing slow queries, checking for connection leaks, monitoring connection pool metrics, increasing connection pool size if necessary, and testing query performance in staging before deployment. Preventative measures involve setting query timeouts, monitoring database connection pool utilization, and regularly reviewing service dependencies and system metrics. Engaging the DBA team for ongoing issues and rolling back recent deployments that may have contributed to the problem are also advised.
