- should identify database pool exhaustion from latency alert: Should identify database pool exhaustion

Suggested param adjustments:
- expected_keywords: Add or allow synonyms: exhausted, hikaripool

- expected_component / expected_cause_type: Align expected labels with LLM wording, or relax matching rules.
  Reason: LLM output may use different terms than scenario expectations.
