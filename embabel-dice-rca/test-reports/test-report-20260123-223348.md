#### Alert
- **ID:** 8abb287d-9e34-4b9b-b7c4-7434db72597c
- **Name:** API P95 Latency Alert
- **Service:** api-service
- **Severity:** WARNING
- **Message:** P95 latency exceeded 500ms threshold. Current value: 2450ms

#### Analysis

**Initial Assessment:**
```
The most likely cause of the incident is the exhaustion of the PostgreSQL connection pool, likely due to slow queries or connection leaks introduced by a recent deployment. Investigation should start by checking the database connection pool utilization (Step 2), followed by analyzing slow queries (Step 3) and checking for connection leaks. Remediation should include optimizing slow queries, reviewing connection management, setting query timeouts, and potentially increasing the connection pool si
...
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
```
The root cause of the incident is the exhaustion of the database connection pool due to slow queries or connection leaks, which led to service errors and high latency. This was evidenced by the connection pool being at 100% utilization, timeout errors indicating unavailability of connections, and a significant increase in request duration (P95) to 2450ms, well above the threshold. Remediation steps include optimizing slow queries, checking for and fixing connection leaks, increasing pool size if necessary, setting query timeouts, and testing database performance in staging before deployment to prevent recurrence.
```

**Recommendations:**
```
To resolve the incident and prevent recurrence, the following actions are recommended: 1) Investigate slow queries in the database causing connection pool exhaustion; 2) Optimize or index slow queries to reduce their duration; 3) Check for and eliminate connection leaks in the application code; 4) Increase the connection pool size if necessary, ensuring it aligns with expected demand; 5) Set appropriate query timeouts to prevent long-held connections; 6) Monitor connection pool utilization and request latency proactively; 7) Conduct thorough testing of query performance in staging before deployment; 8) Roll back recent deployments if they introduced problematic queries; 9) Engage the DBA team for further analysis if connection pool saturation persists; and 10) Implement monitoring and alerting for connection pool metrics to catch similar issues early, ensuring system stability and meeting SLOs.
